The code has been implemented in Matlab R2013a.

In order to run the code, one just need to run "main.m".
At the begining of main, parameters "n" and "epsilon" are 
initialized. There are accurate comments in the file if 
you want to change these parameters.

After running the file a graph will be generated randomly 
with the given input size. Dual scaling algorithm is ran 
to solve it. Then you will be asked if you want to run the 
bruteforce on the graph or not. Optimum values for each 
method will be printed in the console.

Finally, a plot will be created which demonstrates internal
progress of dual scaling algorithm per each iteration.
