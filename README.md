# Maximum-Cut
The code has been implemented in Matlab R2013a.

The program starts from "main.m", in which parameters "n" and "epsilon" are 
initialized in the begining, and can be set manually.

First, Dual scaling algorithm will be run on a randomly generated graph (using the given input size). 
In the next step, the user can choose to run the 
bruteforce on the graph. Optimum values for each 
method will be printed in the console.

Finally, a plot will be created which demonstrates internal
progress of dual scaling algorithm per each iteration.
